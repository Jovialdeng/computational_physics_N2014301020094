•Using Python to solve differential equation.  
##Background
•Learning to solve physics problems by using computer.  
•Learning how to use class function.  
##The Main Body
 Code1:Shows the picture when initial NA=100,NB=0  
 Code2:Shows the difference of NA when initial NA=100,NB=0 and NA=80,NB=20   
 Code3:Shows different NA when dt=0.05 and dt=0.1  
 Code4:Shows different NA when
